# Surfs Up


### Overview
Python, SQLite, Flask

Weather conditions effect consumer spending trends in the outdoor sports markets substantially. The goal of this analysis is to prove that Hawaii weather conditions are viable to support a surfboard outfitter with an attached ice cream shop throughout the year. 

### Results
#### Summer Months
We chose to analize June to represent the weather conditions suring the summer months. 

- Average Temeprature - 75º
- Minimum Temperature - 64º
- Maximum Temperature - 85º

#### Winter Months
We chose to analize December to represent the weather conditions during the winter months.

- Average Temeprature - 71º
- Minimum Temperature - 56º
- Maximum Temperature - 83º

#### Comparison
Though there is some variation between the two months temperature trends, compared to most other places in the United States there is very little variation.
June's temperatures average temperature is only 4 degrees higher than December's average temperature. 
June's minimum temperature is 8 degrees higher than December's minimum temperature, but for a winter minimum temperature to be only 56º is quite mild. 
June's maximum temperatur is only 2 degrees higher than December's maximim temperature, meaning it can get (comparitively) quite warm during the month of Decmeber.

### Summary
Based on the weather data analized a surfing outfitter/ice cream shop would be a vaible option for the location. 
Additional information that could deliver more insight would be an analysis of the percipitation for summer months v. winter months to allow us to know about how many days during these seasons we could expect beach goers to be participating in outdoor events in the area. 
There other data that could support out analysis would include tourism statistics, and water temperature/wave report by season. 
The tourism statistics could give us further information about possible renatls as well as potential foot traffic for the ice cream shop.
the water temperature and wave report could give us insight to what the surf shop specific demographic to cater to. For example: is this a location where it is more avid experanced riders, beginner, or would there be a mix. This information would dramatically effect inventory, as well as sales.
